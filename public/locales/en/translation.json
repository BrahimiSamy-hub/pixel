  "descriptionRulesWerwolf": "The game must be led by a person who does not participate in the game. The leader distributes a card to each player at random. Then each player secretly discovers their identity by looking at their card. The players are divided into two camps: the villagers (some of them playing a special role) and the werewolves. The goal of the villagers is to discover and eliminate the werewolves, and the goal of the werewolves is to avoid being discovered and eliminate all the villagers. The game rounds are paced by a day period and a night period. During the night, all players close their eyes and must not communicate. Called by the game leader, the werewolves wake up and together designate (by gestures to avoid being recognized) a villager who will be their victim. The villagers with special abilities (cupid, witch, seer...) are also called in turn to use their respective powers. When the day returns, everyone wakes up and opens their eyes, and the game leader reveals the identity of the victim(s). The victims do not participate further in the game but can keep their eyes open and watch. The villagers try to discover who the werewolves are through deductions, speeches, revelations... The werewolves (who participate in the discussions, of course: they live in the village!) must avoid being incriminated by diverting suspicion onto others. There is a discussion period during which everyone tries to discover the true identity of each player. At the end of the debate, each player points to a person they suspect to be a werewolf. The one designated by the majority is executed, and the leader reveals their identity. They are eliminated, and the game resumes with nightfall. During the first day, there may be an additional action to perform before deciding on the culprit: the election of the village mayor. Anyone can run (even a werewolf), and their appointment is made by vote. Their power is added to any other abilities they may have, and it is very important. Indeed, during the villagers' vote, their vote counts as double. When the village captain is eliminated (for any reason), they themselves designate their successor with their last breath. The game ends when there are only villagers left or only werewolves.",
